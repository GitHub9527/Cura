Cura is a mobile phone application for the Android platform (Gingerbread 2.3.3 and above).
It is a bundle of remote systems administration tools targeted mainly at sysadmins.

When in the hands of a sysadmin, Cura will provide:
**Personal terminal emulator with full Bash (bourne-again
shell) capabilities. The Terminal also allows adding commands to a Favorites list (ssh, top, uname, uptime, cat /proc/cpuinfo, dmidecode, etc..)

**The SysLog module will allow a user to view usual syslog dumps (kern.log, boot.log, errors.log, etc...) directly from their machine's /var/log/ directory.
The logfile can be either displayed in Head (first 10 lines) or in Tail (last 10 lines). It can also be Head or Tailed for a user-defined number of lines.

**The SysMonitor module displays a graph that is always monitoring CPU and Memory usage.

**Access to the most powerful port/vulnerability-scanning and penetration-testing tools (Nessus, Nmap, Wireshark). (Not until 2.0)

**Also, a security measure/feature has been implemented and it allows users to have Cura's database completely wiped upon them sending the compromised phone a secret pattern of their choosing. (ex: send an SMS message containing "L is dead." to your Android phone and Cura's database will be wiped.)

**Cura is multi-lingual and for now, it supports English, Arabic, German and Greek.
